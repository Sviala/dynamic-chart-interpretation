# Dynamic Chart Interpretation pipeline

THis repo contains the code for a dynamic chart interpretation pipeline, trained on the FigureQA dataset, and build using a version of Kafle et. al (2020) PReFIL model for the CQA head.

Part 1 through 3 represent the training code for reproduceability. The final Production code shows the output from the trained pipeline in a production environment.

The code presented here is formatted as Colab notebooks, thus it is recommended downloading an opening them in Colab for ease of reading. It is also recommended to upload the FigureQA dataset to a GCP bucket and update the file path location in the GCP mounting cells of the notebooks.
